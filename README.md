# Regenerative reforming
This repository contains the modelling and experimental data from our paper submitted to EES

Countercurrent Chemical Looping for Enhanced Methane Reforming with Complete Conversion and Inherent CO2 Separation.
B. Bulfin, M. Zuber, A. Steinfeld,



## 1 Countercurrent thermodynamics
This folder includes the code used for modelling of thermodynamic limits for CH4 reforming with countercurrent oxygen exchange compared to conventional catalytic reforming. The code produces the heat maps shown in Figure 3, plus some additional heat maps.

## 2 PBR experiments
This folder contains the experimental data collected and data anlysis from the packed bed reactor experiments as illustrated in figures 4, and the additional plots shown in ESI.
